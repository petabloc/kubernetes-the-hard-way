# Kubernetes the hard ([GCP](./GCP)) and much harder ([AWS](./AWS)) Way
* [GCP](./GCP)
* [AWS](./AWS)

## Purpose
Right now this is for [Petabloc](https://petabloc.com) training (although others are welcome to use it) and hopefully during this training we will be updating to newest version(s) of K8s and it's various bits.  I also would rather have all the GCP & AWS options in a single repo and not separate branches.
